# WLS-Sindy

**Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (SINDy)** is a powerful framework for model discovery and for generating interpretable surrogate models of dynamic systems.

Traditionally, SINDy uses high-fidelity training data. Even when noise is present, it is typically uniform across all training trajectories.

This repository explores the scenario where noise varies between different trajectories, applying weighted least squares regression in combination with Weak-SINDy to address this challenge.

## Repository Structure

- Code templates (to be added as development progresses)

## Getting Started

Instructions and examples will be provided as code is completed.
