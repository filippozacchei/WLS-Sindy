# Double Pendulum 

We considered a double pendulum system observed through mixed-quality sensors, simulating realistic conditions such as encoder and accelerometer measurements. 
For each trajectory, both high- and low-fidelity observations were generated by adding Gaussian noise of distinct variance to the same underlying dynamics. 
The high-fidelity data emulate precise angular encoders, whereas the low-fidelity data represent noisy camera or accelerometer recordings. 
When all trajectories were used jointly, sparse identification with noise-adaptive weighting successfully recovered the correct nonlinear structure,
whereas unweighted regression was biased by the noisy runs. 
The comparison demonstrates that weighting according to per-sensor noise variance substantially enhances robustness without discarding low-quality data.
